# Assess-Learners-of-Machine-Learning

All files were coded in Python 3, including 1). A classic Decision Tree learner based on JR Quinlan algorithm; 2). A Random Tree learner based on A Cutler algorithm; 3). A Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging) learner ensembled different learners; 4). An Insane leaner used specific use-case of the Bagging learner. Given the same data set, the differences and performance of these learners will be compared, thoroughly discussed, and evaluated by detailed analysis.
